# Linear Optimization
Code to execute various linear optimization algorithms

## Simplex Algorithm
Implements the simplex algorithm for solving linear programming problems. Can only handle basic problems, and only those with feasible solutions. It cannot identify for example, unbounded problems or those with no feasible solutions, or problems that require artificial variables and Phase I - Phase II transitions.
